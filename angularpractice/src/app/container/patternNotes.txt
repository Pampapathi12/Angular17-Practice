### **Explanation of Your Code**

In your code, you're creating an instance of the `Employee` class, and the constructor is called automatically when the `new` keyword is used.

Here‚Äôs a breakdown:

1. **Class Declaration:**
   - The class `Employee` has two data members `name` and `age` declared.
   - The constructor logs `'pampa'` to the console when the object is created.
   - The `displayInfo` method logs `'employee'` to the console when invoked.

2. **Object Creation:**
   - `var emp = new Employee();` creates a new object of `Employee`.
   - This automatically calls the **constructor** of the class `Employee` when the object is instantiated using the `new` keyword.

3. **Constructor and Method:**
   - The constructor is called when `new Employee()` is used, logging `'pampa'` to the console.
   - The method `displayInfo()` is available but is not called in the provided code.

### **Updated Code with Comments**
```javascript
class Employee {
    name; // Data member (property)
    age;  // Data member (property)

    // Constructor method, called when creating a new instance
    constructor() {
        console.log('pampa'); // Logs 'pampa' when a new object is created
    }

    // Data function (method)
    displayInfo() {
        console.log('employee'); // Logs 'employee' when this method is called
    }
}

// Creating a new instance of Employee, which automatically calls the constructor
var emp = new Employee(); // This will log 'pampa'

// You can also call the displayInfo method
emp.displayInfo(); // This will log 'employee'
```

### **Key Points:**
- **`new Employee()`** automatically triggers the constructor.
- The **constructor** is called when you create an instance of the class with the `new` keyword.
- **Data members `name` and `age`** are declared inside the class but aren't initialized, so they will be `undefined` unless explicitly set.

### **What Happens When You Run It:**
- The line `var emp = new Employee();` creates an instance of the `Employee` class, and the constructor logs `'pampa'` to the console.
- Then, you can call the `displayInfo()` method on the object to log `'employee'`.

### **Output:**
```bash
pampa
employee
```

====================
In JavaScript, memory is managed automatically by the **JavaScript engine** (such as V8 for Chrome/Node.js, SpiderMonkey for Firefox, etc.). The engine uses various memory structures and strategies to handle memory allocation and deallocation.

### **Types of Memory in JavaScript**

There are two main types of memory used in JavaScript:

1. **Stack Memory**
2. **Heap Memory**

#### **1. Stack Memory**
- **Stack memory** is used for **primitive values** and function call execution contexts.
- It is **fast and limited** in size.
- The stack follows the **Last In, First Out (LIFO)** principle. This means the last function or variable pushed onto the stack is the first one to be popped out.
  
##### **Characteristics:**
- Used to store **primitive values** like `number`, `string`, `boolean`, `null`, `undefined`, `symbol`, and `BigInt`.
- Stores **function execution contexts** (activation records) and **local variables**.
- When a function is called, its execution context (including variables and parameters) is pushed onto the stack. Once the function finishes, its context is popped off.
  
##### **Example:**
```javascript
function myFunction() {
    let a = 10;  // Primitive type stored on the stack
    let b = 20;
    return a + b;
}
myFunction();
```

In the above example:
- The values `a` and `b` are stored on the stack, as they are **primitive values**.

#### **2. Heap Memory**
- **Heap memory** is used for storing **objects** (arrays, functions, objects, etc.) and **complex data structures**.
- It is **larger and slower** compared to the stack.
- Objects are stored in the **heap**, and a reference to the object is stored on the **stack**.
  
##### **Characteristics:**
- Used for **dynamic memory allocation** of complex objects.
- Objects like arrays, functions, and user-defined objects are stored in the heap.
- Objects can be created dynamically, and the memory can be resized, unlike the stack, which is more rigid.

##### **Example:**
```javascript
let person = { name: "John", age: 30 };  // Object stored in the heap
```

In this example:
- The `person` object is stored in the **heap**.
- A **reference** to the `person` object is stored on the **stack**.

### **How Memory is Managed**

- **Primitive values** are stored directly on the stack, and their value is copied when assigned to another variable.
  
  ```javascript
  let x = 10;
  let y = x;  // The value 10 is copied from `x` to `y`
  ```

- **Objects** and **arrays** are stored in the heap, and when you assign one object or array to another variable, it copies the reference (memory address), not the actual object.

  ```javascript
  let obj1 = { name: "Alice" };
  let obj2 = obj1;  // `obj2` now points to the same object as `obj1` in the heap
  ```

### **Garbage Collection in JavaScript**
JavaScript uses **garbage collection** to manage memory automatically. When an object is no longer in use or there are no references pointing to it, the JavaScript engine will **automatically free up** the memory by reclaiming it.

- **Mark-and-sweep** is a common garbage collection technique. The garbage collector marks objects that are reachable (i.e., there is still a reference to them), and then it sweeps through the memory to remove those that are unreachable.

### **Memory Leaks**
A **memory leak** occurs when memory that is no longer in use is not freed. In JavaScript, this can happen if:
- References to objects are unintentionally kept, preventing the garbage collector from reclaiming the memory.
- Circular references (e.g., object A referencing object B, and object B referencing object A) that are no longer in use.

### **Summary:**

1. **Stack Memory**:
   - Used for **primitive values** and **function call contexts**.
   - Fast and has a limited size.
   - Follows **LIFO** principle.
  
2. **Heap Memory**:
   - Used for **objects** (arrays, functions, etc.).
   - Slower than stack but has a larger size.
   - Stores **references** to objects in the stack.
  
3. **Garbage Collection**:
   - JavaScript automatically manages memory using garbage collection to clean up unused memory.

Let me know if you'd like more details or further explanations on any of these concepts!

===========
Here‚Äôs a **diagrammatic explanation** of **Stack Memory** and **Heap Memory** in JavaScript.

---

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Stack Memory (for Primitive Values & Function Calls)**  
- The **Stack** is used for storing **primitive values** and **execution contexts** (function calls).
- It follows the **LIFO (Last In, First Out)** principle.

#### **Example Code:**
```javascript
function demo() {
    let a = 10;  // Stored in Stack
    let b = 20;  // Stored in Stack
    return a + b;
}
demo();
```

#### **Stack Memory Representation:**
```
+-----------------+
| demo() Context  | <- Pushed onto the stack when called
|  a = 10         |
|  b = 20         |
+-----------------+
| Global Context  | <- Always present
+-----------------+
```
- When `demo()` is called, a **new execution context** is created and pushed onto the stack.
- After execution, `demo()` is removed from the stack.

---

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Heap Memory (for Objects & Arrays)**  
- **Heap memory** is used to store complex data structures like **objects, arrays, and functions**.
- References to these objects are stored in the **Stack**.

#### **Example Code:**
```javascript
let person = { name: "Alice", age: 30 };  // Stored in Heap
let employee = person;  // Both variables reference the same object
```

#### **Memory Representation:**
```
Stack:                        Heap:
+-----------------+          +----------------------+
| person (ref)   |  ----->  | { name: "Alice",     |
| employee (ref) |  ----->  |   age: 30 }          |
+-----------------+          +----------------------+
```
- `person` and `employee` **both point to the same object** in the Heap.
- If you modify `employee.name`, it also changes `person.name` since both reference the same memory location.

---

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Stack vs Heap Memory ‚Äì Side-by-Side**
| Feature       | Stack Memory       | Heap Memory         |
|--------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Stores**   | Primitive values, function calls | Objects, arrays, functions |
| **Size**     | Small & fast | Large but slower |
| **Access**   | LIFO (Last In, First Out) | Dynamic, scattered memory allocation |
| **Example**  | `let x = 10;` (Stored directly) | `let obj = {name: "Bob"};` (Stored in heap, reference in stack) |

---

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Garbage Collection (Automatic Memory Cleanup)**
- If an object **has no references left**, the **garbage collector** removes it from the heap.
- Example:
```javascript
let obj = { name: "Alice" }; // Stored in Heap
obj = null; // Garbage Collector removes the object
```
**Diagram (Before & After GC)**:
```
Before GC:               After GC:
Stack -> obj (ref)  ---> Heap { name: "Alice" }    Stack -> obj = null
                          (Object is unreachable, so it's removed)
```

---

### **Conclusion**
- **Stack Memory**: Fast, limited size, used for **primitive types & function calls**.
- **Heap Memory**: Large, stores **objects, arrays, functions**, but slower.
- **Garbage Collection**: Automatically cleans up unreferenced objects in the heap.

========
When you create an object using `new Employee()`, JavaScript **allocates memory in both the Stack and Heap**. Let‚Äôs break this down **step by step** with a **diagrammatic explanation**.  

---

## **Step 1: Code Execution**
```javascript
class Employee {
    constructor(name, age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }
}

let emp1 = new Employee("Alice", 30);  // Object created
let emp2 = new Employee("Bob", 25);    // Another object created
```

---

## **Step 2: Memory Allocation**  
When `new Employee("Alice", 30)` is executed:  

1. **A new object is created in Heap Memory.**
2. **A reference (memory address) to that object is stored in Stack Memory.**
3. **The constructor assigns properties (`name` and `age`) to the object.**

---

## **Step 3: Diagram of Memory Allocation**  

### **Stack Memory (stores references)**  
```
Stack:
+----------------+
| emp1 (ref) ---> 0x001  (Heap) |
| emp2 (ref) ---> 0x002  (Heap) |
+----------------+
```
- `emp1` and `emp2` store memory **references** (pointers) to their respective objects in the **Heap**.

### **Heap Memory (stores actual objects)**
```
Heap:
0x001  { name: "Alice", age: 30 }  <-- emp1 points here
0x002  { name: "Bob", age: 25 }    <-- emp2 points here
```
- The actual objects `{ name: "Alice", age: 30 }` and `{ name: "Bob", age: 25 }` are stored **inside the Heap**, and the **Stack** contains **references (memory addresses)** to these objects.

---

## **Step 4: What Happens When emp1 = null?**
If you set `emp1 = null`, it **removes the reference** from the **Stack**, but the object still exists in the **Heap** until **Garbage Collection** removes it.

```javascript
emp1 = null;  // The object { name: "Alice", age: 30 } is now unreachable
```

### **Updated Diagram (After Setting `emp1 = null`)**
```
Stack:
+----------------+
| emp1 = null    |
| emp2 (ref) ---> 0x002 (Heap) |
+----------------+

Heap:
0x001  { name: "Alice", age: 30 }  <-- (Garbage Collector will clean this)
0x002  { name: "Bob", age: 25 }
```
Now, `{ name: "Alice", age: 30 }` has **no references**, so it will be **removed** by the **Garbage Collector**.

---

## **Summary**
- `new Employee()` creates an **object in Heap Memory**.
- A **reference** to the object is stored in **Stack Memory**.
- If the reference is removed (`null` or reassigned), the object becomes **eligible for Garbage Collection**.
