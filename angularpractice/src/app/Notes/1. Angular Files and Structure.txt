package.json

every project have package.json all the configuration and node modules
dependencies -> angular dependencies project directly dependent
devDependencies -> third party dependencies
editconfig -> setup the environment of angular different coding standards, developer to follow the coding standards
gitignore -> git repo ignore the exclude the while code pushing to the repo
angular.json - > contains the all configuration of angular project
package-lock.json -> environment same to all the area , production, development , integration environment
tsconfig.json -> convert the typescript compiler going to compile the typescript into javascript
src -> 
app -> in angular Application , multiple Application in that single compoenent and 1 module File 
assests -> static assests images, text, -> those are public can access anywhere in the Application
assests/image.jpg
index.html main  html file when applicatoin start its render, 
main.ts -> starting point of the applicatoin, when we are start the angular application its load the bootstrapModule -> appModule
style.css -> Globally added the css each compoenent of the applications
zone.js -> 
=======================================================
`zone.js` is a library used in Angular to handle asynchronous operations and change detection. It provides a way to manage and intercept asynchronous tasks like events, timers, and HTTP requests, ensuring that Angular's change detection mechanism runs whenever these tasks complete.

### Key Points About `zone.js`:

1. **Execution Context:**
   - `zone.js` creates execution contexts, called "zones," to track and manage asynchronous operations.

2. **Integration with Change Detection:**
   - Angular uses `zone.js` to automatically trigger change detection after an asynchronous operation (e.g., a timer, HTTP request) completes. This ensures that the UI stays up-to-date with the latest application state.

3. **Patching APIs:**
   - `zone.js` monkey-patches browser APIs such as `setTimeout`, `Promise`, and `addEventListener`. By doing this, it keeps track of all asynchronous operations and ensures Angular knows when they complete.

4. **How It Works in Angular:**
   - When an asynchronous operation occurs, `zone.js` intercepts it and notifies Angular.
   - Angular then runs its change detection mechanism to update the view with the latest changes.

5. **Zone Context Propagation:**
   - `zone.js` maintains a "zone context" for every async operation, which helps propagate context across different parts of an application.

### Example Workflow with `zone.js`:
1. A user clicks a button triggering an HTTP request.
2. `zone.js` intercepts the HTTP request and marks it as pending.
3. Once the HTTP response is received, `zone.js` marks the task as complete.
4. `zone.js` notifies Angular, which triggers change detection to update the UI.

### Benefits of Using `zone.js`:
- Simplifies managing asynchronous operations.
- Reduces the need to manually trigger change detection (e.g., calling `ApplicationRef.tick()` or `ChangeDetectorRef.detectChanges()`).

### Limitations and Alternatives:
- **Performance Overhead:**
  - The monkey-patching and tracking of all async operations can introduce a slight performance overhead.
  
- **Custom Zone Configuration:**
  - You can create custom zones or disable specific patches if needed for better performance or compatibility.

- **`zone.js` Alternatives:**
  - Angular can run without `zone.js` by using `noop` zone (`NgZone` with `NoopNgZone`), but in such cases, you must manually handle change detection.

### Related Configuration:
In Angular, `zone.js` is included by default in the `polyfills.ts` file:

```typescript
import 'zone.js';  // Included with Angular CLI.
```

You typically don't need to interact with `zone.js` directly as Angular handles it under the hood, but understanding it is important for advanced debugging and performance tuning.
